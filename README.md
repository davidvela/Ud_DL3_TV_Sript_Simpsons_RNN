# Projec3: Generate TV Scripts (SIMPSONS) 

## Introduction
In this project, you'll generate your own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

### To do: 
* Implement the following preprocessing f(): Lookup_tables (words to Ids) and tokenize_puntuation
* Implement: get_inputs 
* Implement: get_init_cell 
* Implement: get_embed 
* Build RNN: tf.nn.dynamic_rnn()
* build nn 
* implement get_batches 
* Hyperparameters 
* **TRAIN** AND **EVALUATE**
* get_tensors 
* pick_word 
* **GENERATE** **SCRIPTS**


##Advanced Projects
After completing this project, try applying what you learned to one of these problems.
